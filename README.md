# Investigate: Pick a location on a map and get the address
## Tasks
- Check known libs for location picking support
- At the best do not use (google) maps -> DSGVO
- Build a small local prototype outside of the project to demo the picker

### Alternatives to Google Maps API

There are a bunch of alternatives to Google Maps API available, both open source and commercial. These links may provide some insight on that.

### Libraries which can intergrate OpenStreetMap

https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Frameworks

### Candidates
1. Mapbox GL JS (Up to 50,000 free, 50,000 to 100,000 $5 per 1,000, mapping)
2. LocationIQ ($100/monthly for 50,000 reqs/day, mapping and searching)
3. Gisgraphy (120â‚¬/monthly for 43,200 reqs/day, mapping and searching)
4. Openlayers (Free, mapping)
5. Leaflet (Free, mapping)
6. Nominatim (Free, searching)

## Why Nominatim and Leaflet?

1. Nominatim https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/
